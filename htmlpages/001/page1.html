		<h1> This HTML file explores the header tag.</h1><br><br>

		<h2> As the number for the header tag increases, up to 6,</h2><br><br>

		<h3> the size of the font decreases.</h3><br><br>

		<h4> This quick poem will soon come </h4><br><br>

		<h5> to a close when the tag reaches </h5><br><br>

		<h6> the number 6.</h6><br><br>

		<h6> There's comfort in staying and understanding</h6><br><br>

		<h6> the place that you reside.</h6><br><br> 

		<h5> To grow again wouldn't be so bad either...</h5><br><br>

		<h4> To feel like the expansion is for the better.</h4><br><br>

		<h3> Knowing that you're going back to your highest point.</h3><br><br>

		<h4> But... then... you get back to a place where you can't grow.</h4><br><br>

		<h4> And maybe you feel stagnant for a bit.</h4><br><br>

		<h4> You feel like you aren't getting worse,</h4><br><br>

		<h4> But you aren't getting better.</h4><br><br>

		<h3> Finally you do get better, though!</h3><br><br>

		<h2> You grow. And keep growing.</h2><br><br>

		The header tag is different from the "bold" tag, however.<br><br>

		<b> You can tell here when the tag is used.</b><br><br>

		<b> They do look quite similar but like everything else in the world, they are different.</b><br><br>
