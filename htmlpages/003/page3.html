		This page is based on the comment tag. 

		Had I not clarified previously, you would've thought you were looking at a blank web page...

		But ALAS.

		Here are some comments.

		The purpose of the comment tag is for the people behind the scenes (us) to make comments without the actual viewer of the webpage seeing them- until you view the page inspector.

		<a href="../index.html">Back to Home</a>	
		<a href="../004/page4.html">Next page</a>

		</center>

	<!--
	
		However, since the viewer can't see the comments, any code that's made won't affect the placement of the code that can actually be seen. 

		This is why the centered links above^ still float to the top of the page.
