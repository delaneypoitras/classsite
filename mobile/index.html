	<div class="mobileabout">Mobile was a project that focused on how we consider web pages specifically made to be seen in a mobile space. My project took the idea of magnetic poetry and moved it from the typical space of our refrigerator and moved it to the mobile space. It also uses poems that already exist and gives the user to rearrange them in any way they see fit. It is best experienced on a mobile device!</div>
