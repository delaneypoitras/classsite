		Container Technologies, a Core Studio Interaction project, was based around containers found in a certain environment. The environment I chose, my room, lead me to think about containers that I wear, apply to my body, simply look at and admire, or containers that take a certain form, like a box.
		<br><br>
		The descriptions of the items begin with descriptions from the manufacturer or seller, and end with my personal favorite (or least favorite) thing about the item. My description also plays on how humorous (or contrastingly, how serious) descriptions online can be.
